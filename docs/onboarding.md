# Onboarding Checklist

- Clone repo and run `git log --graph --oneline --all` to view history.
- Work on feature branches off `develop`.
- Open PRs into `develop`; prefer `--no-ff` merges to preserve context.
- Promote to `staging` for release candidates; tag RCs.
- Tag releases on `main`; back-merge to `develop` if needed.
